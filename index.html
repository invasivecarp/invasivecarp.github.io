                The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a species of fish native to Europe and Asia. Carp can be categorized into four main species: Grass, Silver, Black, and Bighead. As a whole, these carp are recognized as Asian Carp.

                The introduction of Asian Carp in the United States dates back to the 1960s, brought in order to control algae and weed growth, treat sewage, and maintain the health of agriculture ponds. Recently, Asian Carp have escaped into major ecosystems such as
                the Mississippi River and Illinois River, although they are generally established in the East Coast. These rivers connect to the Great Lakes, home to environmentally sensitive organisms. Should they successfully establish themselves in
                the Great Lakes, the environmental consequences would be devastating; a reason why efforts are amplifying to remove these invasive fish.

            <div class='content'>
                The migration of Asian Carp has been the major factor influencing the affected species. Their migration started at the Mississippi River Basin, which connects to more than 31 different regions across North America, including Canada. Through this migration,

            <div class='content'>
                One of these connections include the link between the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes (through the Illinois-Michigan Canal). The Great Lakes feature diverse species, some of which are unfortunately endangered. The emerging presence of the Asian Carp
                does not make this any better, and if anything, should prompt more action to be taken towards their spread.

                    <li>Unintentional Manipulation
                        <ul>
                            <li>The voracious eating habits of Asian Carp made them perfect candidates for agricultural purposes within the US. With this, they were transported to the US to assist combating rising algae levels and poor water quality in agricultural
                                farms. However, they were able to spread by water contaminated with eggs. </li>
                            <li>Fishermen come into contact with water while catching fish. If they fish in an area with a high population of Asian Carp (or at the very least an area in which Asian Carp were sighted), they run the risk of carrying their eggs
                                on clothing or in their boat. This can allow eggs to move from one body of water to another.</li>
                            <li>Flooding can occur, which is beyond the control of humans. This causes water levels in lakes and rivers to rise, which makes it easier for carp to jump out of blocked areas (e.g. dams) and move between bodies of water.</li>

            <div class='subtitle'>Properties of Asian Carp</div>
            <b>Reproduction</b>
            <div class='content'>
                Asian Carp have the ability to populate rapidly. Surprisingly, Asian Carp best lay their eggs in fast moving water, allowing their transport to other regions of water.
            </div>
            <b>Jumping</b>
            <div class='content'>
                Asian Carp have been able to cross gaps that are difficult to pass by jumping. By doing so, they are able to move through canals, rivers, and even through dams.

            <b>Outcompetition</b>
            <div class='content'>
                Because Asian Carp have the ability to spread and grow quickly, it is very easy for them to overtake entire habitats, thus affecting the surrounding ecosystem. The largest area of concern is the Great Lakes, which is home to at least 70 endangered species.
                These species rely on plankton and other microorganisms to survive, which is what Asian Carp also tend to eat. This, paired with their staggering numbers, practically destroys any possibility of the survival of existing species.
            </div>
            <b>Destruction of Ecosystems</b>
            <div class='content'>
                Because Asian Carp have the ability to feed on large amounts of plankton, existing organisms within an ecosystem may die off quickly (especially endangered species). These organisms may be a dependency of other organisms, and very quickly the food chain
                crumbles from the bottom up, thereby destroying that habitat.

            <div class='content'>
                There are various methods of treating the water to repel and mitigate the means Asian Carp use to spread. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Water Shocking/Electric Barrier</b> - Electricity has proved to be the easiest form of protection. Simply shocking the water or placing an electric barrier downstream of a river deters the fish, preventing it from migrating to sensitive
                        areas.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Bio-Poison</b> - Scientists have been working on a poison targeted towards Asian Carp that would kill adult fish (preventing them from laying more eggs) and their eggs (preventing more fish from spawning).</li>
